	Fix weirdness when autodetect hangs for a long time

	Separate the resolve hostname and autodetect into two separate threads.

	Add a timeout for resolve hostname (10 seconds).

	Add a timeout for autodetect datacenter (30 seconds).

	Transition from initializing -> initialized when both resolve hostname and autodetect have completed.

	If autodetect times out, the result from resolve hostname is still valid and there.

	Rename "next_server_autodetect_finished" to "next_server_ready"

	Rename "next_server_autodetect_datacenter" to "next_server_datacenter"

	Implement whois.txt file cache for whois results.

	Work out why the whois output was truncated in log. It's harmless, it was just the next_printf buffer being 1024 byte only.

	Fix compile warning for memset 0 next_session_entry_t reported by Tu.

	Update documentation to reflect "next_server_ready" and "next_server_datacenter".

	Document NEXT_DISABLE_AUTODETECT

TODO

	Document disable_autodetect
