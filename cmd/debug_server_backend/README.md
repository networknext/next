# Debug Server Backend

**IMPORTANT** This service is only to be used by internal developement teams. It's primary purpose is to mimic the functionality of the server backend and allow for teams to add debug logs and additional visibility tweaks without effecting live customers.

The Debug Server Backend is responsible for:

1. Listening for test game servers that come online
2. Pulls the route matrix from the relay backend
3. Accepts test client sessions from the test game server to find relays near the client, find a route, and send it back to the test game server
4. Send route information to the portal cruncher so that the sessions can be viewed in the portal
5. Records metrics and billing information so that the routes being served are billed accordingly

### Load & Scalability

Status: **HIGH**
Scalability: **N/A**

1. Test game clients and test game servers send UDP packets every 10 seconds
2. The only network calls made during these requests are to the portal cruncher to send portal data and to Google PubSub to send billing information, everything else is done in memory or in the background across the network to build a local cache

### Logging

Levels are cumulative so if you set `BACKEND_LOG_LEVEL=info` you will get `error` and `warn` too.

### Environment Variables

#### Required to Run

- `ENV`: the environment the service is running in. Should be either local, dev, staging, or prod
- `SERVER_BACKEND_PRIVATE_KEY`: the private key of the server_backend to sign responses
- `RELAY_ROUTER_PRIVATE_KEY`: the private key of the router used to encrypt routes

#### Required for All Functionality

- `ROUTE_MATRIX_URI`: a URL or local file path to a route matrix binary
- `MAXMIND_CITY_DB_URI`: a URL to the Maxmind City DB
- `MAXMIND_ISP_DB_URI`: a URL to the Maxmind ISP DB
- `FIRESTORE_EMULATOR_HOST`: an IP and port to connect to a running firestore emulator 
- `PUBSUB_EMULATOR_HOST`: an IP and port to connect to a running pubsub emulator 

#### Required for Cloud Environment

- `GOOGLE_PROJECT_ID`: The GCP project ID for the environment the service is being run in
- `PORTAL_CRUNCHER_HOST`: a TCP hostname for the portal cruncher. Make sure this is an internal IP address
- `REDIS_HOST_MULTIPATH_VETO`: a redis IP and port to connect to store multipath veto data

#### Optional

- `BACKEND_LOG_LEVEL`: one of `none`, `error`, `warn`, `info`, `debug`. Default `warn`
- `MAX_NEAR_RELAYS`: The maximum number of near relays to send down to a client. Cannot be greater than `32`. Default `32`
- `NEXT_DEBUG_LOGS`: turns on logging to TTY via the core `Debug` function

- `POST_SESSION_BUFFER_SIZE`: The size of the post session buffer in bytes. Default `1000000`
- `POST_SESSION_PORTAL_MAX_RETRIES`: The number of times to retry on a post session portal update before dropping the portal data. Default `10`
- `POST_SESSION_PORTAL_SEND_BUFFER_SIZE`: The size of the ZeroMQ buffer for post session data. Default `1000000`
- `MULTIPATH_VETO_SYNC_FREQUENCY`: The frequency at which to sync multipath veto data from redis. Default `10s`
- `NUM_THREADS`: The number of goroutines to allocate for UDP packet processing. Default `1`
