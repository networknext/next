# General Info

The Relay is responsible for:

1. Routing packets across other relays in the network to and from the game client and server
2. Sending stats updates to the relay_backend that are optimized for route generation

Whenever changes are made to the relay, update the `RELAY_VERSION` define in config.hpp appropriately. Also within "cmd/next/relay.go" update the `LatestRelayVersion` constant to the same value.

# Pre-build setup

## Dependencies

`sudo apt install g++-8 rapidjson-dev libsodium23 libsodium-dev libgtop2-dev`

### If on Ubuntu 18.04

`sudo add-apt-repository ppa:mhier/libboost-latest`
`sudo apt update`
`sudo apt install libboost1.70-dev`

### If on Ubuntu 20.04

`sudo apt install libboost-all-dev`

- `g++-8`: Specifically version 8. This is because newer versions of Ubuntu come with g++-9 as a default and compiling with that doesn't let the Ubuntu 18.04 servers run the relay.
- `RapidJSON`: Fast JSON parsing header only library.
- `libsodium`: Encryption/decryption/signature/etc... library.
- `libgtop2`: For gathering system usage, notably cpu & memory usage
- `Boost`: Specifically for Beast, Boost's http library

## Environment Variables

### Required

- `RELAY_ADDRESS`: The address the other relays and sdk should talk to.
  - Example `RELAY_ADDRESS='127.0.0.1:1234'`
- `RELAY_PUBLIC_KEY`: The public key of the relay encoded in base64.
  - Example `RELAY_PUBLIC_KEY='9SKtwe4Ear59iQyBOggxutzdtVLLc1YQ2qnArgiiz14='`
- `RELAY_PRIVATE_KEY`: The corresponding private key encoded in base64.
  - Example `RELAY_PRIVATE_KEY='lypnDfozGRHepukundjYAF5fKY1Tw2g7Dxh0rAgMCt8='`
- `RELAY_ROUTER_PUBLIC_KEY`: The router's public key encoded in base64, used to encrypt data for relay verification.
  - Example `RELAY_ROUTER_PUBLIC_KEY='SS55dEl9nTSnVVDrqwPeqRv/YcYOZZLXCWTpNBIyX0Y='`
- `RELAY_BACKEND_HOSTNAME`: The backend's hostname
  - Example `RELAY_BACKEND_HOSTNAME='http://localhost:30000'`

### Optional
- `RELAY_MAX_CORES`: Number of cores to allocate to the relay. Each relay thread is assigned affinity starting at core 0 to n - 1. If unset the relay will attempt to auto detect the number of processors on the system. For VMs in the cloud, this should be set to 1/2 the available processors.
  - Example `RELAY_MAX_CORES='1'` or `RELAY_MAX_CORES="$(( $(nproc) / 4 ))"`
- `RELAY_SEND_BUFFER_SIZE` & `RELAY_RECV_BUFFER_SIZE`: In bytes, lets you set the amount of memory to use for each socket's send & receive buffers.
  - Example `RELAY_SOCKET_BUFFER_SIZE="4000000"`
  - Note, Macs apparently have issues with values above a million, thus "1000000" is the default value if not set

# Building

Several makefiles are available for building. If you are not developing the relay you probably want the release build.

## Release

`make release`

- Only enables the Log() macro.
- Only enables the -O3 flag for optimization, the remaining performance flags are commented out, using them will produce a non-portable binary. Unless the performance gain is necessary, these should remain unused.
- Defines `NDEBUG` to disable assertions and other debug related things.
- Use `make run-release` to run the exe. Alternatively execute directly with `bin/relay` or from the repo root dir `dist/relay`

## Debug

`make debug`

- Enables the LogDebug() macro and redirects all Log() macros to LogDebug().
- Compiles with no optimization and the -g flag for debug information.
- Disables all forms of optimization and enables the -g flag in gcc.
- Use `make run-debug` to run the exe. Alternatively execute directly with `bin/relay.debug`

## Test

`make test`

- For executing tests only.
- Enables the LogTest() macro. Functions just like the others but is only enabled for test builds as to not clutter output. All others are disabled.
- Disables all forms of optimization and enables the -g flag in gcc.
- Use `make run-tests` to run them. Alternatively execute directly with `bin/relay.test`

## Benchmarks

`make benchmark`

- For running benchmarks only
- Disables all log macros. Ensure the code is working before benchmarking.
- Enables many optimizations to ensure fair benchmarks.
- Use `make run-benchmarks` to run them. Alternatively execute directly with `bin/relay.benchmark`

## Shutdown procedures

The relay can be shutdown in a few ways depending on the signals you give it.

### Clean shutdown

Signal: SIGHUP

This shutdown makes sure that any sessions going across the relay have time to redirect to another route before the relay shuts down.

  1. Tell the backend it is shutting down, and then upon getting a response wait an additional 30 seconds.
  2. Wait 60 seconds and then proceed with shutting down if there is no communication with the backend.

### Hard shutdown

Signals: SIGINT, SIGTERM

The relay will join threads, clean up memory, and log it's shutting down.

Any sessions running across the relay will be disrupted and potentially time out or disconnect.

### Regular process termination

All other signals will result in killing the relay process in the standard way.
