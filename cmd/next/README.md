# Network Next Operator Tool

Run `./next` in the root of the repo for available commands.

## Select

To remove a seller: `next sellers remove <id>`

Removes a seller with the given seller ID from Firestore. The seller ID can be found with `next sellers`

## Datacenters

To list datacenters: `next datacenters`

To add a datacenter: `next datacenters add [filepath]`

Adds a datacenter to Firestore based on the given JSON file. You can also pipe in the JSON data (ex. `cat datacenter.json | next datacenters add`)
To see an example datacenter JSON schema, use `next datacenters add example`

To remove a datacenter: `next datacenters remove <name>`

Removes a datacenter with the given datacenter name from Firestore.

## Relays

To list relays: `next relays`

To add a relay: `next relays add [filepath]`

Adds a relay to Firestore based on the given JSON file. You can also pipe in the JSON data (ex. `cat relay.json | next relays add`)
To see an example relay JSON schema, use `next relays add example`

To remove a relay: `next relays remove <name>`

Removes a relay with the given relay name from Firestore.

## Route Shaders

To get a route shader: `next routeshader <buyer ID>`

Gets a route shader for a given buyer ID. You can find a buyer's ID with `next buyers`.

To set or update a route shader: `next routeshader set <buyer ID> [filepath]`

Sets a route shader in Firestore for a given buyer based on the given JSON file. You can also pipe in the JSON data (ex. `cat relay.json | next routeshader set <buyer ID>`)
To see an example route shader JSON schema, use `next routeshader set example`

## Edit Buyer

To edit a buyer's values: `next buyer edit <buyer ID> [filepath]`

Edits a buyer's values directly based on the given JSON file. You can also pipe in the JSON data (ex. `cat buyer.json | next buyer edit <buyer ID>`)
To see an example JSON schema, use `next buyer edit example`. Only include fields that should be changed and omit any that shouldn't.

## SSH

To SSH: `next ssh [identifier]`

SSH into a remote device. You must set the SSH key before attempting to connect to a device, otherwise you will get denied.

To set the SSH key: `next ssh key [path to key file]`

- You can't use '~' in the path directly, it must be expanded by the shell first. Or in other words don't quote the argument

## Relay

### Enable

To Enable a relay: `next relay enable [relay name]`

The tool will SSH into the specified relay and start the relay service and set the state to enabled. If the service is already running the command will only update the state to enabled.

### Disable

To Disable a relay: `next relay disable [relay name]`

First the tool will update the relay's state in Firestore to the Disabled state. Then it will SSH into a relay, stop the relay service, and end the session. If the service is already stopped the tool will do nothing.

### Update

To Update a relay: `next relay update [relay name]...`

The tool will perform several actions to update a relay.

First you must build the relay binary and ensure it is located at `dist/relay`

Then disable the relay using the [disable](#Disable) functionality

Then you use the tool. You must have the desired environment set via the [relay env](#Env) setting. The tool will query the relay(s) from Firestore and then perform an update on those selected. If any fail for any reason the program will quit and not continue to the next. While updating it will re-generate public and private keys for the relay and set them both in the relay's environment file and publish the changes to Firestore as well. Lastly the command will update the state of the relay to enabled, much the same way the [enable](#Enable) command does it.

### Revert

To Revert a relay: `next relay revert [relay name]...`

The tool will revert a relay back to the the previous version. It will remove the binary and associated files that are currently active and restore the most recent backup.

### Set NIC Speed

To set the NIC speed of a relay: `next relay setnic <relay name> <value (Mbps)>`

This will adjust the NIC speed field in Firestore for the given relay to the provided value in Mbps.

### Keys

To see the public and update keys of a relay: `next relay keys <relay name>`

Shows the public key and update key for the given relay.

### State

To set the state of a relay direct: `next relay state <state> <relay name> [relay names...]`

Sets the state of a relay directly in Firestore. Note that this command should be avoided and only used when the state logic is not working correctly.

Valid states are `enabled`, `offline`, `maintenance`, `disabled`, `quarantine`, and `decommissioned`

### Check

To check relays: `next relay check [filter]`

Displays a table of filtered relays, or all relays if no filter supplied, containing diagnostic information.

If any of the fields contain "SSH Error", a more detailed message will be visible within the messages above the table.

Fields:
- `SSH`: Was the relay able to be SSHed into?
- `Ubuntu`: The version of Ubuntu the relay is running.
- `Cores`: The cores allocated to the relay. If the `RELAY_MAX_CORES` environment variable is set, its value will used here.
- `Ping Backend`: Was the relay able to ping the relay backend?
- `Running`: Is the relay service running?
- `Bound`: Is port 40000 bound to the relay process?

Regarding SSH ability: The tool uses ssh's `-o` flag with `ConnectTimeout=60`. This means the tool will report false if the relay is unreachable for 60 seconds. If the relay is reachable and will take longer than 60 seconds, the tool will continue. So for very distant relays, and especially those with high packet loss, this tool function may take 2 or 3 minutes to complete.

## Cost

Downloads the current cost matrix from the relay backend to 'cost.bin' or the first argument supplied.

## Optimize

Optimizes the downloaded cost matrix into a route matrix.

The first argument is the rtt threshold which defaults to 1. \
The second argument is the path of the cost matrix if you don't have it saved as 'cost.bin'. \
The third argument is the path you want the route matrix written to. Default is 'optimize.bin'.

## Analyze

Analyzes the route matrix and produces high level data. The file read in is 'optimize.bin' or the first argument supplied.
