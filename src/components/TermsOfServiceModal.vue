              Network Next anonymizes any personal data during collection and before it is transmitted and stored by Network Next, by removing all direct and indirect identifiers, and on which technical, organizational, and legal controls reasonably prevent re-identifying individuals so that it is no longer personally-identifiable data as defined under the applicable privacy regulations (“Personal Data”). The collected data which is anonymized consists of the user's IP address and their user id (e.g, Steam ID, PSN ID) (the "Anonymized Data").
            </p>
            <p>
              Network Next also collects other aggregated, non-personally identifiable internet usage analytics, including the route calculated for the user to reach the server, when and how long the user is connected to the server, RTT, jitter, and packet loss statistics about the user's connection, broad geographical data inferred based on IP Address, and the user's ISP name and their ISP's ASN (the "Technical Data"). No Personal Data is contained in the Technical Data.
            </p>

              By agreeing to this Agreement, you hereby grant to Network Next the irrevocable, worldwide, perpetual, royalty-free right to access, use, reproduce, distribute, display, assign, sell, license, sublicense, and create derivative works from Technical Data and Anonymized Data, for any purpose (to the extent permitted by law) at Network Next's sole discretion.

            <p>
              The Agreement, and all future agreements you enter into with us, unless otherwise indicated on such other agreement, will be governed by the laws of the State of New York. This is the case regardless of whether you reside or transact business with us, or any of our affiliates or agents, in the State of New York or elsewhere. Unless a dispute would be governed by the terms of the Section entitled Binding Arbitration below or if governed by your Services Agreement, where applicable, you agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located within the city of New York, NY, United States.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>For EU users only:</strong> In the event of a dispute relating to the interpretation, performance, or validity of this Agreement, an amicable solution can be sought before any legal action. You can file your complaint with Network Next by sending a message via email to support@networknext.com. In case of failure, you can, within one year of the failed request, have recourse to an Alternative Dispute Resolution procedure by filing an online complaint on the European Commission’s Online Dispute Resolution website: https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/odr/main/index.cfm?event=main.home.chooseLanguage. If out-of-court dispute resolutions fail, the dispute may be brought before the competent courts.

              Binding Arbitration
            </div>
            <p>
              Except as otherwise agreed in the Services Agreement, where applicable, any dispute or claim relating in any way to your use of the Service (each, a “Claim”) will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court (except that you may assert claims in small-claims court if your claims qualify). You agree that each Claim must be brought individually.
            </p>
            <p>
              YOU AND NETWORK NEXT AGREE THAT (i) THERE IS NO RIGHT OR AUTHORITY FOR ANY DISPUTE TO BE ARBITRATED ON A CLASS ACTION BASIS OR TO UTILIZE CLASS ACTION PROCEDURES; (ii) THERE IS NO RIGHT OR AUTHORITY FOR ANY DISPUTE TO BE BROUGHT IN A PURPORTED REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY OR AS A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL; AND (iii) NO ARBITRATION MAY BE JOINED WITH ANY OTHER ARBITRATION.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law apply to this Agreement and this binding arbitration clause.
            </p>
            <p>
              Arbitration is a process with no judge or jury – an arbitrator will review the arguments in the dispute and award damages and other relief just like a court would. The arbitrator must follow this Agreement as a court otherwise would. Court review of the arbitration award is limited under the Federal Arbitration Act.
            </p>
            <p>
              To start an arbitration, you must send an email to support@networknext.com describing your Claim and requesting arbitration, or we may do the same by sending a written notice requesting arbitration to your address. The proceedings will be conducted through JAMS, using their Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures. You can view these rules at jamsadr.com or by calling 800-352-5267. The payment of the initial filing fees will be made by the party filing the Claim, and any other filing and other fees will be apportioned as directed by the JAMS rules. The arbitration will take place in New York, NY, USA, unless the Parties agree to video, phone, or internet connection appearances.
            </p>
            <p>
              Except as otherwise set forth below, you may seek any remedies available to you under federal, state or local laws in an arbitration action. As part of the arbitration, both you and Network Next will have the opportunity for discovery of non-privileged information that is relevant to the Claim. The arbitrator will provide a written statement of the arbitrator’s decision regarding the Claim, the award given (including any attorneys’ fees and costs awarded), and the arbitrator’s findings and conclusions on which the arbitrator’s decision is based.
            </p>
            <p>
              Notwithstanding the terms of this Section, either of us may bring a lawsuit in court for equitable relief, for any misuse or infringement of intellectual property rights, or for any Claim related to, or arising from, allegations of theft, piracy, invasion of privacy, or unauthorized use of the Service.
            </p>
            <p>
              BY AGREEING TO THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION, YOU UNDERSTAND THAT YOU AND NETWORK NEXT WAIVE THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A JURY TRIAL.
            </p>
            <p>
              You and Network Next agree that if any portion of this Section is found illegal or unenforceable, that portion will be severed and the remainder of the Section will be given full force and effect.

            </div>
            <p>
              <strong>Agreement Revisions:</strong> This Agreement may only be revised in writing by Network Next, or by Network Next’s publication of a new version on the Service.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Force Majeure:</strong> Network Next is not liable for any delay or failure to perform resulting from causes outside the reasonable control of Network Next, including without limitation any failure to perform hereunder due to unforeseen circumstances or cause beyond Network Next’s control such as acts of God, war, terrorism, riots, embargoes, acts of civil or military authorities, fire, floods, accidents, strikes, or shortages of transportation facilities, fuel, energy, labor, or materials.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>No Partnership:</strong> You agree that no joint venture, partnership, employment, or agency relationship exists between you and Network Next because of this Agreement or your use of the Service.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Assignment:</strong> Network Next may assign this Agreement, in whole or in part, to any person or entity at any time with or without your consent. You may not assign the Agreement without Network Next’s prior written consent, and any unauthorized assignment by you will be null and void.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Severability:</strong> If any part of this Agreement is determined to be void, invalid or unenforceable, then that portion will be severed, and the remainder of the Agreement will be given full force and effect.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Attorneys’ Fees:</strong> In the event any litigation or dispute resolution is brought by either party in connection with this Agreement, the prevailing party in such litigation will be entitled to recover from the other party all the reasonable costs, attorneys’ fees and other expenses incurred by such prevailing party in the proceedings.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>No Waiver:</strong> Our failure to enforce any provision of this Agreement will in no way be construed to be a present or future waiver of such provision, nor in any way affect the right of any party to enforce every such provision thereafter. The express waiver by us of any provision, condition or requirement of this Agreement will not constitute a waiver of any future obligation to comply with such provision, condition or requirement.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Equitable Remedies:</strong> You hereby agree that Network Next would be irreparably damaged if the terms of this Agreement were not specifically enforced, and therefore you agree that we will be entitled, without bond, other security, or proof of damages, to appropriate equitable remedies with respect to breaches of this Agreement, in addition to such other remedies as we may otherwise have available to us under applicable laws.
