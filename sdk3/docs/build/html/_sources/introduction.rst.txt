Welcome to Network Next!

Network Next is the marketplace for premium network transit. 

Our technology monitors each player's network connection and finds routes across private networks with better performance than the public internet. 

We do this by running bids on our marketplace on your behalf every 10 seconds for each player. When we find a route that meets your optimization requirements, our SDK steers game traffic off the public internet and across our network of private networks.

If at any point Network Next is down, our SDK simply falls back to the public internet, without any disruption to your players.
