DONE

	Pass over and understand existing code

	Remove a bunch of dead code in the relay backend and relay gateway

	Update to pass in both redis hostname and redis cluster, and create redis client instance

	Mock up new approach with redis on a timer event

	Add a http handler to relay gateway to return the set of relay backends known

	In the future, if the relay gateway still breaks in the same way, I can inspect it by looking at the "/status" endpoint. 

	For example, by checking # of goroutines, memory allocated etc.

TODO

	Actually call into redis with "HSET" and set "HEXPIRE" so the key expires (It's O(n) but it's fine... small n)

	Read the hash with "HGET" and extract the set of relay backends from the keys

	Very carefully look over the code that forwards relay updates and make sure it has timeout set and is safe

    I should now be able to run and test the code locally, at first by running each service manually, and then as a part of happy path, and it should pass.

    Update both the dev, staging and prod terraforms to pass in the redis hostname/cluster for relay_backend and relay_gateway.

    Move the update logs for the relay backend set to debug logs.

    Setup a dev environment again, and deploy the code there, verifying it is working, and stable for a few days.

    Then it is time for us to deploy to prod.
