DONE

	Define portal message and make sure it has all data we need

	Fill out the portal message as much as possible and send it to the channel

	Add next bandwidth exceeded up/down bools to portal data

	Get the pusher service live in the dev environment so we can make changes to the database.bin easily. ()

	SDK5 server backend needs to move to 40000 port by default. Can adjust it to 45000 in run.go as needed. (van)

	Implement random portal message function

	Implement unit test for portal message

	Implement write portal message

	Implement read portal message

	Verify unit test passes for portal message

	Implement code in server_backend5 cmd to process portal messages on channel.

TODO

	Extend server backend 5 to write portal messages and send them to redis streams (needs configuration env vars for this...)

	Defaults should work in local.

	---------

	Implement a portal_cruncher_new service using the new service framework

	Setup a number of threads via env var.

	Verify that the new portal cruncher receives portal messages.

	---------

	Work out how to implement new portal cruncher... optimize as you go.

	---------

	Verify that portal functionality is working with raspberry clients in dev.

	---------














Essentials:

	--------------

	Send messages to analytics from server backend 5 via google pubsub.

	--------------

	Extend analytics service to insert billing messages into bigquery.

	--------------

	Leader election needs to wait at least 11 seconds to make sure it gets the correct result when > 2 vms start at the same time without flap

	--------------

	Leader election func testing for relay backends + ready delay

	--------------

	Implement func test for server backend to make sure when it is in connection drain state, it indicates to the LB health test that traffic should not be sent to it.

	--------------

	Extend the relay to support a secondary relay backend.

	This will enable relays to be shared between dev and dev5, and prod and prod5.

	--------------









Nice to have:

	--------------

	Code in service.go to only shut down service once various subsystems have reported that they're complete

	Extend this to the server backend to make sure that we flush all channels of messages before shutting down

	--------------

	Change SDK to pass up the real packet loss, real jitter, real out of order etc.

	We don't need to store multiple uint64 in session data to calculate this

	It's wasteful to pass this data back to the client with each session update response.

	--------------

	Create a new message for near relay stats.

	Unit test it, then on slice #1 when near relay data comes in, write a near relay ping stats message and send it.

	--------------

	Implement the near relay ping token.

	We need to do this now, so we don't have problems with it in the future.

	It can be as simple as an expire time for pings

	The relay can also have a count of the maximum number of pings to reply to, eg. 10 * 10 = 100.

	--------------

	Implement a fix for a re-ordering of route tokens / continue tokens to create loops. Order of tokens must be enforced.

	This probably means we need to have some sort of signed bit, that indicates that indeed, this is token n, n+1 etc.

	And then this can be checked.

	Needs to be designed...

	--------------

	Extend the SDK5 so we have the option of sending down new near relay stats on multiple slices, later on.

	Use a near relay ping sequence # (uint8) so we can tell when we have new near relay pings that we should upload to the backend.

	Add a func test to make sure we capture this functionality. We want the option to redo near relay pings on later slice, in the future without changing the SDK.

	--------------

	Multipath across two network next routes.

	--------------

	It would be good to track when sessions shut down, vs. having them always time out

	This would require new messages up then back down the chain of relays for ack

	It would also reduce the risk of missing packets or having sessions time out and not noticing.

	We can now track sessions timing out before being closed, and this would indicate problems (or at least, hard disconnects...)

	Again, adding this later would be challenging. Best to do it now.

	--------------

	Rework the reference relay and make it the official relay.

	The trick is to use the code from the proxy to go wide across n threads with SO_REUSEPORT

	Since each port/address maps to a specific socket, there is no need for locks across the session map, there will be a session map per-thread.

	Stats can be managed with atomics, eg. count of sessions per-thread in a uint64 atomic, summed by the main thread before uploading the total to the relay backend.

	--------------

	A relay which has its firewall misconfigured will cause players to fallback to direct, because traffic can't be sent to it.

	Would be nice if the relay backend would talk to the relay over its UDP port and say hi, and if this heartbeat was a prerequisite for the relay coming online.

	This way misconfigured relays can't cause problems.
