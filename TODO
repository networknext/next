DONE

	Raspberry client should hit the raspberry backend to get a list of servers to connect to, and connect to one randomly.

	Setup raspberry client to be a self-contained program that runs multiple clients on n threads.

	Raspberry client number of threads is pulled from RASPBERRY_CLIENT_NUM_THREADS env var, default to 25.

	Raspberry client and server should get raspberry backend address from env var set in envs/local.env

	Setup raspberry_client and raspberry_server artifacts to be built and uploaded in semaphore.

	Ask van to setup raspberry_client, raspberry_server and raspberry_backend MIGs in dev.

	Only raspberry backend needs health check and LB.

	The rest should just be a raw mig that we scale up/down manually.

TODO

	We need to track max direct packet loss seen

	Need to take the max of direct PL and real PL when calculating max direct PL seen

	---------

	I believe that a key component of the old system was comparing max packet loss on direct vs. max PL on relays, so over time we had some code that went "ok, so we have intermittent packet loss, loosen it up on the near relays".

	We also would need to not filter out relays forever, but instead, store them unmolested, and filter them temporarily before we use them for routing.

	Once this is done, we can remove the packet loss threshold.


























	--------------

	Gotta fix all sdk4 and sdk5 building

	--------------

	Test the UE4 plugin and make sure the command line stuff is in there for mountain top and multiversus

	--------------



























	--------------

	Why does it only ever show 7 routes, for 7 near relays?

	Is there something in our code that restricts to the best route, per-near relay only?

	--------------

	The leader election is pretty clearly broken.

	I can start one relay backend, then start another, -- and the new one immediately becomes the leader. No...

	--------------

	Setup google.virginia.3 relay myself, so I can understand the process and potentially streamline it.

	-----------------

	Streamline the process to setup a new machine to be a relay.

	-----------------

	Instead of trying to change the hostname, just change the shell prompt to the relay name. Much easier, with no side effects.

	-----------------

	Build a relay release process in semaphore.
