DONE

	Rework minimal ip2location functionality IP -> (lat,long) into service.go

	Remove the SDK5_LocationData, it's just stupid. Just lat/long folks...	

	Fix various session update tests that broke with the lat/long change

	Implement reload of ip2location reader every n seconds

	Update tests with the new near relay stuff

	Only swap ip2location reader if the validation passes

	Hook up ip2location to the sdk5 session update handler for server_backend5.

	Relay works with ref backend.

	Fix up backend5.go to work with current SDK5 packets

	Update ref backend 5 keypairs to latest being passed in via run.go with env vars

	Rename reference components to have "reference_*" prefix, so it is clear.

	Make sure all reference components get built with "make build".

	Server5 now handshakes with ref backend.

TODO

	Can we now get a client routing across relays w. ref backend5?

	No. Desync in session update packet:

	------------

	Get the reference backend 4 proven working as well.

	------------





























































	---------

	SDK5 server backend needs to move to 40000 port by default. Can adjust it to 45000 in run.go as needed.

	---------

	Implement the relay backend checking signature as needed to secure relay updates

	Get the pusher service live in the dev environment so we can make changes to the database.bin easily









Essentials:

	--------------

	Send messages to the portal cruncher via redis streams.

	--------------

	Adjust the portal cruncher so it uses the new service framework and reads messages from redis streams.

	--------------

	Verify that portal functionality is working with raspberry clients in dev.

	--------------

	Send messages to analytics from server backend 5 via google pubsub.

	--------------

	Extend analytics service to insert billing messages into bigquery.

	--------------

	Leader election needs to wait at least 11 seconds to make sure it gets the correct result when > 2 vms start at the same time without flap

	--------------

	Leader election func testing for relay backends + ready delay

	--------------

	Implement func test for server backend to make sure when it is in connection drain state, it indicates to the LB health test that traffic should not be sent to it.

	--------------

	Extend the relay to support a secondary relay backend.

	This will enable relays to be shared between dev and dev5, and prod and prod5.

	--------------











Nice to have:

	--------------

	Create a new message for near relay stats.

	Unit test it, then on slice #1 when near relay data comes in, write a near relay ping stats message and send it.

	--------------

	Implement the near relay ping token.

	We need to do this now, so we don't have problems with it in the future.

	It can be as simple as an expire time for pings

	The relay can also have a count of the maximum number of pings to reply to, eg. 10 * 10 = 100.

	--------------

	Implement a fix for a re-ordering of route tokens / continue tokens to create loops. Order of tokens must be enforced.

	This probably means we need to have some sort of signed bit, that indicates that indeed, this is token n, n+1 etc.

	And then this can be checked.

	Needs to be designed...

	--------------

	Extend the SDK5 so we have the option of sending down new near relay stats on multiple slices, later on.

	Use a near relay ping sequence # (uint8) so we can tell when we have new near relay pings that we should upload to the backend.

	Add a func test to make sure we capture this functionality. We want the option to redo near relay pings on later slice, in the future without changing the SDK.

	--------------

	Multipath across two network next routes.

	--------------

	It would be good to track when sessions shut down, vs. having them always time out

	This would require new messages up then back down the chain of relays for ack

	It would also reduce the risk of missing packets or having sessions time out and not noticing.

	We can now track sessions timing out before being closed, and this would indicate problems (or at least, hard disconnects...)

	Again, adding this later would be challenging. Best to do it now.

	--------------

	Rework the reference relay and make it the official relay.

	The trick is to use the code from the proxy to go wide across n threads with SO_REUSEPORT

	Since each port/address maps to a specific socket, there is no need for locks across the session map, there will be a session map per-thread.

	Stats can be managed with atomics, eg. count of sessions per-thread in a uint64 atomic, summed by the main thread before uploading the total to the relay backend.
