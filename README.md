This is a monorepo that contains the Network Next backend.

## Development

IMPORTANT: This repo uses [Git Submodules](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules) to link in the [SDK](https://github.com/networknext/console). In order for this to work you need clone and interact with this repo over [SSH](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/connecting-to-github-with-ssh).

```bash
> git clone git@github.com:networknext/backend.git
> git submodule init
> git submodule update
```

The tool chain used for development is kept simple to make it easy for any operating system to install and use and work out of the box for POSIX Linux distributions.

- [GCP Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/quickstarts): needed for the `gsutil` command to publish artifacts
- [Redis](https://redis.io)
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
- [make](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/make.1.html)
- [sh](https://linux.die.net/man/1/sh)
- [Go](https://golang.org/dl/#stable) (at least Go 1.13)
- [g++](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/g++.1.html)
    - [libcurl](https://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/)
    - [libsodium](https://libsodium.gitbook.io)
    - [libpthread](https://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/libpthread.html)

Developers should install these requirements however they need to be installed based on your operating system. Windows users can leverage WSL to get all of these.

## Running the "Happy Path"

A good test to see if everything works and is installed is to run the "Happy Path". For this you will need to run the following commands **in separate terminal sessions**.

1. `redis-cli flushall && make BACKEND_LOG_LEVEL=info dev-relay-backend`: this will clear your local redis completely to start fresh and then run the relay backend
2. `make dev-multi-relays`: this will run 10 instances of a relay and each will register themselves with the relay backend
3. `make BACKEND_LOG_LEVEL=info dev-server-backend`: this will run the server backend and start pulling route information from the relay backend every 10 seconds
4. `make dev-server`: this will run a fake game server and register itself with the server backend
5. `make dev-client`: this will run a fake game client and request a route from the server which will ask the server backend for a new route for the game client

You should see the fake game server upgrade the clients session and get `(next route)` and `(continue route)` from the server backend which it sends to the fake game client.

Simultaneously you will see the terminal with the relays logging `session created` indicating traffic is passing through relays.

## Backend

All of these services are controlled and deployed by us.

- [`cmd/relay`](cmd/relay)
- [`cmd/relay_backend`](cmd/relay_backend)
- [`cmd/server_backend`](cmd/server_backend)

## SDK

The [`SDK`](./sdk) is shipped to customers to use in their game client and server implementations. The client and server here are slim reference implementations so we can use the SDK locally.

- [`cmd/server`](./cmd/server)
- [`cmd/client`](./cmd/client)

## Docker and Docker Compose

While all of the components can be run locally either independently or collectively it can be tedious to run multiple relays to get a true test of everything. We can leverage Docker and Docker Compose to easily stand everything up as a system. There is a [`./cmd/docker-compose.yaml`](./cmd/docker-compose.yaml) along with all required `Dockerfile`s in each of the binary directories to create the system of backend services (`relay_backend` and `server_backend`).

### First Time

The first time you run the system with Docker Compose it will build all the required `Dockerfile`s and run them.

From the root of the project you can run `docker-compose` and specify the configuration file to stand everything up.

```bash
$ docker-compose -f ./cmd/docker-compose.yaml up
```

### Second, Third, Forth, and N Times

After all of the `Dockerfile`s have been built subsequent runs of `docker-compose up` will ONLY run them. If you make changes to any of the code you need to rebuild all of the services.

```bash
$ docker-compose -f ./cmd/docker-compose.yaml build
```

Once everything is rebuilt you can run everything again to see your changes.

```bash
$ docker-compose -f ./cmd/docker-compose.yaml up
```

### One Service at a Time

Some instances you only want to run some instances at a time and you would use `docker-compose run SERVICE_NAME`. Read the `./cmd/docker-compose.yaml` for all the service names.

```bash
$ docker-compose -f ./cmd/docker-compose.yaml run relay_backend
```
